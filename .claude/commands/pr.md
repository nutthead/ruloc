# Create High-Quality Pull Request for ruloc

Create a professional GitHub pull request tailored for the ruloc project, analyzing changes and generating comprehensive PR content.

## Workflow

### 1. Branch Assessment and Preparation

**Check current branch:**
```bash
git branch --show-current
```

**If on master branch:**
- Analyze the staged or recent changes:
  ```bash
  git status
  git diff --cached
  git log -1 --oneline
  ```
- Generate an appropriate branch name based on the changes:
    - Use conventional prefixes: `feat/`, `fix/`, `refactor/`, `docs/`, `chore/`, `perf/`, `test/`, `ci/`
    - Create descriptive, kebab-case names (e.g., `feat/json-output`, `fix/test-detection`, `perf/memory-optimization`)
- Create and checkout the new branch:
  ```bash
  git checkout -b <generated-branch-name>
  ```

**If already on a feature branch:**
- Proceed with the current branch

### 2. Analyze Changes

**Gather comprehensive information about the changes:**

```bash
# Get the list of changed files
git diff master...HEAD --name-status

# Get detailed diff
git diff master...HEAD

# Get commit messages
git log master..HEAD --oneline

# Get detailed commit information
git log master..HEAD --pretty=format:"%h - %s%n%b"
```

### 3. Generate PR Content

**Analyze the gathered information and create:**

**Title:**
- Follow conventional commit format: `type(scope): description`
- Types: `feat`, `fix`, `refactor`, `docs`, `style`, `test`, `chore`, `perf`, `ci`, `build`
- Common scopes: `cli`, `parser`, `stats`, `io`, `tests`, `docs`, `ci`, `analysis`
- Keep it concise (50-72 characters preferred)
- Use imperative mood (e.g., "Add feature" not "Added feature")

**Body:**
Structure the PR description matching the project's style (with emojis and detailed sections):

```markdown

### 4. Create the Pull Request

**Ensure branch is pushed:**
```bash
# Push current branch to origin
git push -u origin HEAD
```

**Create the PR using GitHub CLI:**
```bash
gh pr create \
  --base master \
  --head <current-branch> \
  --title "<generated-title>" \
  --body "<generated-body>"
```

**Alternative interactive mode (if you need to make edits):**
```bash
gh pr create --base master --head <current-branch> --web
```

### 5. Verification and Output

**After creating the PR:**
1. Display the PR URL
2. Show a summary of what was created
3. Remind about CI checks that will run:
   ```
   ‚úÖ PR created successfully!

   The following CI checks will run automatically:
   - Quick checks (fmt, clippy, docs)
   - Security audit
   - Unit tests (4 platforms)
   - Code coverage (with PR comment)

   Monitor the checks at: <PR_URL>
   ```

## Best Practices for ruloc

1. **Ensure all quality checks pass locally** before creating PR:
   ```bash
   cargo fmt --all -- --check && \
   cargo clippy --all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings && \
   cargo test && \
   cargo tarpaulin
   ```

2. **Use conventional commits** - All commits should have been created via the `/c` command

3. **Include line references** - When describing changes, include `src/main.rs:line-range` references

4. **Single-file context** - Remember that all code is in `src/main.rs` (except tests)

5. **Coverage awareness** - Ensure new code is tested and coverage stays ‚â•70%

6. **Keep PRs focused** - One logical change per PR for easier review and cleaner git history

7. **Document performance impacts** - If changes affect performance, include measurements

8. **Link to issues** - Use GitHub keywords (Fixes, Closes, Resolves) to auto-close issues

9. **Add appropriate emojis** - Match the project's style with emoji categories (üöÄ, üîß, üìù, etc.)

10. **Consider release-plz** - Your commits will be grouped by type in the changelog

## Error Handling

- If not in a git repository, inform the user
- If no changes exist, inform the user to commit first (suggest using `/c`)
- If `gh` is not authenticated, prompt: `gh auth login`
- If the branch already has an open PR, show the existing PR: `gh pr list --head <branch>`
- If on master branch with uncommitted changes, warn about creating a feature branch first

## Notes

- **Base branch**: Always use `master` (this project does not use `main`)
- **Commit format**: Follows conventional commits with footer tags (`$feat`, `$fix`, `$no-changelog`)
- **Coverage requirement**: Minimum 70% (enforced by CI)
- **Test count**: Currently 158 tests (mention if this changes)
- **Release process**: PRs merged to master trigger release-plz to create release PRs
- **CI platform**: GitHub Actions with caching and parallel execution
- **Required tools**: GitHub CLI (`gh`) must be installed and authenticated
