# CI/CD Security Issue Resolution Report

**Date:** 2025-10-05
**Analyst:** Claude Code
**Focus:** Cosign keyless signing OIDC issuer misconfiguration
**Status:**  Resolved and Committed

## Executive Summary

An expert-identified security issue in the GitHub Actions release workflow has been confirmed, analyzed, and fixed. The issue involved an incorrect OIDC issuer configuration in the cosign artifact signing step that could cause signing failures or produce unverifiable signatures.

## Expert's Report Analysis

### Original Finding

> **Incorrect cosign OIDC issuer (breaks keyless signing)**
> - Location: `.github/workflows/release.yml:321-326`
> - Issue: `cosign sign-blob` is invoked with `--oidc-issuer="${FULCIO_URL}"`. `FULCIO_URL` is the CA, not the OIDC issuer. The correct issuer for GitHub Actions is `https://token.actions.githubusercontent.com`.
> - Impact: Signing can fail or produce unverifiable signatures.
> - Fix: Prefer defaults (cosign auto-detects on Actions) or set explicitly: `--oidc-issuer "https://token.actions.githubusercontent.com"`. If you want to pin endpoints via env, use the variables cosign recognizes (e.g., `COSIGN_OIDC_ISSUER`, `COSIGN_FULCIO_URL`, `COSIGN_REKOR_URL`), not `FULCIO_URL`/`REKOR_URL` alone.

### Verification Status:  CONFIRMED

The expert's analysis is **completely accurate**. Research confirms:

1. **Conceptual error identified:** The workflow was confusing two distinct components:
   - **Fulcio URL** (`https://fulcio.sigstore.dev`): Certificate Authority that issues signing certificates
   - **OIDC Issuer** (`https://token.actions.githubusercontent.com`): Identity provider for authentication

2. **Impact confirmed:** This misconfiguration would:
   - Potentially cause signing operations to fail
   - If signatures were created, they would be unverifiable
   - Create a mismatch with the verification step which expects the correct issuer

3. **Evidence of inconsistency:** The workflow's own verification step (line 539) demonstrates the correct configuration, confirming the signing step was inconsistent.

## Research Findings

### Technical Background

**Sigstore Keyless Signing Workflow:**
```
User/Workflow � OIDC Issuer � Identity Token � Fulcio CA � Code Signing Certificate � Rekor Transparency Log
```

**Component Roles:**
- **OIDC Issuer**: Authenticates the signer and provides identity tokens
  - For GitHub Actions: `https://token.actions.githubusercontent.com`
  - For public Sigstore: `https://oauth2.sigstore.dev/auth`
- **Fulcio**: Certificate Authority that validates identity tokens and issues certificates
  - Public instance: `https://fulcio.sigstore.dev`
- **Rekor**: Transparency log for signature records
  - Public instance: `https://rekor.sigstore.dev`

### Cosign Documentation Review

From official Sigstore/cosign documentation:

1. **Auto-detection capability**: When running in GitHub Actions with `id-token: write` permission, cosign can auto-detect the GitHub Actions OIDC provider
2. **Explicit configuration**: The `--oidc-issuer` flag should point to the identity provider, not the CA
3. **Environment variables**: Standard names are `COSIGN_OIDC_ISSUER`, `COSIGN_FULCIO_URL`, `COSIGN_REKOR_URL`

## Root Cause Analysis

### The Misconfiguration

**Before (Incorrect):**
```yaml
env:
  FULCIO_URL: https://fulcio.sigstore.dev  # Certificate authority
  REKOR_URL: https://rekor.sigstore.dev    # Transparency log

...

cosign sign-blob \
  --yes \
  --oidc-issuer="${FULCIO_URL}" \  # L WRONG: Using CA URL as OIDC issuer
  --output-signature="${file}.sig" \
  --output-certificate="${file}.crt" \
  "$file"
```

**After (Correct):**
```yaml
cosign sign-blob \
  --yes \
  --oidc-issuer="https://token.actions.githubusercontent.com" \  #  CORRECT
  --output-signature="${file}.sig" \
  --output-certificate="${file}.crt" \
  "$file"
```

### Why This Matters

The OIDC issuer value is embedded in the signing certificate and must match during verification:

**Verification step (already correct):**
```yaml
cosign verify-blob \
  --certificate test-artifact.tar.gz.crt \
  --signature test-artifact.tar.gz.sig \
  --certificate-identity-regexp "$WORKFLOW_ID" \
  --certificate-oidc-issuer "https://token.actions.githubusercontent.com" \  # Expects GitHub issuer
  test-artifact.tar.gz
```

If the certificate was signed with the wrong issuer, this verification would fail.

## Resolution

### Changes Applied

**File:** `.github/workflows/release.yml`
**Line:** 323
**Change:** Updated `--oidc-issuer` parameter

```diff
- --oidc-issuer="${FULCIO_URL}" \
+ --oidc-issuer="https://token.actions.githubusercontent.com" \
```

### Rationale for This Approach

**Considered Options:**

1.  **Explicit OIDC issuer** (chosen)
   - Clear and self-documenting
   - Consistent with verification step
   - No dependency on auto-detection behavior
   - Best for security auditing

2. L **Remove `--oidc-issuer` entirely** (alternative)
   - Would work (cosign auto-detects on GitHub Actions)
   - Less explicit
   - Relies on environment detection
   - Harder to audit

3. L **Use environment variables**
   - Would require renaming to `COSIGN_OIDC_ISSUER`, `COSIGN_FULCIO_URL`, etc.
   - More changes required
   - Current custom env vars aren't used elsewhere

**Decision:** Option 1 provides the best balance of clarity, consistency, and auditability.

### Additional Observations

**Environment Variable Naming:**

The workflow currently defines:
```yaml
FULCIO_URL: https://fulcio.sigstore.dev
REKOR_URL: https://rekor.sigstore.dev
```

These are **custom names** and are not recognized by cosign. Standard names would be:
- `COSIGN_FULCIO_URL`
- `COSIGN_REKOR_URL`
- `COSIGN_OIDC_ISSUER`

**Current Impact:** Low - These variables are only referenced by the now-fixed signing command.

**Recommendation:** Could be removed or renamed in future cleanup, but not required for functionality since cosign uses public defaults when these aren't set.

## Verification of Fix

### Consistency Checks

 **Signing and verification now match:**
- Signing uses: `--oidc-issuer="https://token.actions.githubusercontent.com"`
- Verification expects: `--certificate-oidc-issuer "https://token.actions.githubusercontent.com"`

 **Workflow permissions adequate:**
- `id-token: write` is set (line 288)
- Enables GitHub Actions OIDC token acquisition

 **Documentation consistency:**
- Release notes template (lines 422-431) shows correct verification commands
- Security documentation references correct issuer

### Testing Recommendations

To fully validate this fix in production:

1. **Trigger a test release:**
   ```bash
   # Create a test tag
   git tag v0.1.2-test
   git push origin v0.1.2-test
   ```

2. **Monitor signing job:**
   - Verify cosign sign-blob succeeds without errors
   - Check that `.sig` and `.crt` files are generated

3. **Manual verification:**
   ```bash
   # Download artifacts
   VERSION="0.1.2-test"
   ARTIFACT="ruloc-${VERSION}-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu.tar.gz"

   curl -L -o test.tar.gz "https://github.com/nutthead/ruloc/releases/download/v${VERSION}/${ARTIFACT}"
   curl -L -o test.tar.gz.sig "${ARTIFACT}.sig"
   curl -L -o test.tar.gz.crt "${ARTIFACT}.crt"

   # Verify signature
   cosign verify-blob \
     --certificate test.tar.gz.crt \
     --signature test.tar.gz.sig \
     --certificate-identity-regexp "https://github.com/nutthead/ruloc/.github/workflows/release.yml@.*" \
     --certificate-oidc-issuer "https://token.actions.githubusercontent.com" \
     test.tar.gz
   ```

4. **Inspect certificate:**
   ```bash
   openssl x509 -in test.tar.gz.crt -text -noout | grep -A 5 "Issuer"
   ```
   Should show GitHub Actions OIDC issuer in the certificate extensions.

## Commit Summary

### Commit 1: Primary Fix
```
commit 960607c
fix(ci): Correct cosign OIDC issuer for GitHub Actions

Fixed incorrect OIDC issuer in cosign sign-blob command. Was using
FULCIO_URL (certificate authority) as the OIDC issuer, which would
cause signing failures or unverifiable signatures.

Changes:
- Changed --oidc-issuer from ${FULCIO_URL} to the correct GitHub
  Actions OIDC issuer: https://token.actions.githubusercontent.com
- Now consistent with verification step (line 539)

$fix
```

### Commit 2: Documentation
```
commit 259de6b
docs(reports): Add comprehensive workflow diagrams to CI analysis

Enhanced docs/reports/02-analyze-ci.md with detailed Mermaid diagrams
for workflow visualization.

$docs
```

## Impact Assessment

### Before Fix

**Risk Level:** High
**Probability:** 100% (every release)

**Potential Failures:**
- L Signing operations fail during release

## Major Finding #2: Certificate Identity Ref Mismatch

### Expert's Report Analysis

> **Signature verification ties identity to master branch, but releases are tagged**
> - Location: `.github/workflows/release.yml:534-540`
> - Issue: Verification uses `--certificate-identity-regexp` with `.../release.yml@refs/heads/master`. Release runs are triggered by tags (`refs/tags/v*`).
> - Impact: Verification will fail even if signatures are correct.
> - Fix options:
>   - Match tags: `.../.github/workflows/release.yml@refs/tags/v.*`
>   - Or use a more robust regex anchored to workflow path only (and optionally repo owner): `.../.github/workflows/release.yml@.*` combined with `--certificate-oidc-issuer https://token.actions.githubusercontent.com`.

### Verification Status: ✅ CONFIRMED

The expert's second finding is also **completely accurate**. This is a critical mismatch that would cause all signature verifications to fail.

### The Problem

**Certificate Identity Format in Fulcio:**

When Fulcio issues a code signing certificate for GitHub Actions, it embeds the workflow identity in the Subject Alternative Name (SAN) field using this format:

```
https://github.com/{owner}/{repo}/.github/workflows/{workflow}@{git-ref}
```

Where `{git-ref}` follows Git's ref format:
- **Branches:** `refs/heads/{branch-name}`
- **Tags:** `refs/tags/{tag-name}`

**The Mismatch:**

1. **Workflow triggers** (line 13-16):
   ```yaml
   on:
     push:
       tags:
         - "v*.*.*"
   ```
   When triggered by a tag push, `GITHUB_REF` is `refs/tags/v1.2.3`

2. **Certificate contains:** `https://github.com/nutthead/ruloc/.github/workflows/release.yml@refs/tags/v1.2.3`

3. **Verification expects** (line 534):
   ```yaml
   WORKFLOW_ID="...release.yml@refs/heads/master"
   ```

4. **Result:** Verification fails because `refs/tags/v1.2.3` ≠ `refs/heads/master`

### Additional Instance Found

The same incorrect pattern was also found in the **release notes template** (line 424), which provides verification instructions to end users. This would cause user verification attempts to fail as well.

### Research Findings

**From Sigstore/Fulcio Documentation:**

- The OIDC token from GitHub Actions includes the `job_workflow_ref` claim
- This claim contains the full ref path (e.g., `octo-org/octo-automation/.github/workflows/oidc.yml@refs/heads/main`)
- Fulcio embeds this in the certificate's SAN
- Verification must match the exact ref that triggered the workflow, or use a pattern

**Best Practices:**

1. **Specific matching:** Use exact ref patterns when you know the trigger (e.g., `@refs/tags/v.*` for tag-triggered releases)
2. **Flexible matching:** Use `@.*` when the workflow can be triggered multiple ways (tags, manual dispatch, etc.)
3. **Security consideration:** The `--certificate-oidc-issuer` parameter provides the primary security boundary, so `@.*` is acceptable when combined with correct OIDC issuer

### Resolution

**Approach Chosen:** Flexible regex pattern (`@.*`)

**Rationale:**
- The release workflow can be triggered by **both** tag pushes AND manual `workflow_dispatch`
- Manual dispatch doesn't specify a ref format in advance
- Using `@.*` works for all scenarios:
  - Tag-based: `@refs/tags/v1.2.3` ✅
  - Manual from master: `@refs/heads/master` ✅
  - Manual from feature branch: `@refs/heads/feature-xyz` ✅
- Security is still maintained via `--certificate-oidc-issuer` validation

**Changes Applied:**

**File:** `.github/workflows/release.yml`

**Change 1 - Release notes template (line 424):**
```diff
- WORKFLOW_ID="https://github.com/${{ github.repository }}/.github/workflows/release.yml@refs/heads/master"
+ WORKFLOW_ID="https://github.com/${{ github.repository }}/.github/workflows/release.yml@.*"
```

**Change 2 - Verification step (line 534):**
```diff
- WORKFLOW_ID="https://github.com/${{ github.repository }}/.github/workflows/release.yml@refs/heads/master"
+ WORKFLOW_ID="https://github.com/${{ github.repository }}/.github/workflows/release.yml@.*"
```

### Security Analysis

**Question:** Is `@.*` too permissive?

**Answer:** No, when used correctly:

1. ✅ **Correct OIDC issuer specified:** `--certificate-oidc-issuer "https://token.actions.githubusercontent.com"`
   - This is the primary security control
   - Ensures the certificate was issued for a GitHub Actions workflow

2. ✅ **Workflow path is specific:** `.../.github/workflows/release.yml`
   - Only signatures from THIS workflow are accepted
   - Not just any workflow in the repository

3. ✅ **Repository is validated:** `https://github.com/{owner}/{repo}/...`
   - Embedded in the WORKFLOW_ID pattern via `${{ github.repository }}`
   - Only signatures from THIS repository are accepted

4. ✅ **Multiple trigger methods are legitimate:**
   - Tag-based releases (primary method)
   - Manual dispatch for hotfixes or rereleases
   - Both are valid release scenarios

**What `@.*` prevents:**
- ❌ Signatures from different workflows
- ❌ Signatures from different repositories
- ❌ Signatures from different OIDC issuers

**What `@.*` allows:**
- ✅ Signatures from the same workflow triggered by different git refs
- This is exactly what we want for a multi-trigger release workflow

### Impact Assessment

**Before Fix:**

**Risk Level:** Critical
**Probability:** 100% (every release)

**Failures:**
- ❌ Automated verification step would always fail
- ❌ User verification following release notes would always fail
- ❌ Signatures are valid but appear invalid
- ❌ Supply chain security verification broken
- ❌ Users cannot trust artifacts
- ❌ Defeats the entire purpose of signing

**After Fix:**

**Risk Level:** Minimal
**Verification:** Pending production release

**Improvements:**
- ✅ Verification pattern matches actual certificate content
- ✅ Works for both tag-triggered and manual releases
- ✅ Release notes provide working verification instructions
- ✅ Users can successfully verify artifact signatures
- ✅ Supply chain security guarantees are functional

## Lessons Learned

1. **Infrastructure vs. Identity:** Understanding the distinction between authentication infrastructure (OIDC issuer) and certificate infrastructure (Fulcio CA) is critical for keyless signing workflows.

2. **Git ref awareness:** When workflows are triggered by different mechanisms (tags, branches, manual), the git ref format changes and this affects certificate identity verification.

3. **Consistency validation:** When workflows have both signing and verification steps, these should be validated for consistency during development and review. Additionally, documentation examples should match actual implementation.

4. **Environment variable naming:** Using standard, tool-recognized environment variable names reduces confusion and potential misuse.

5. **Documentation value:** Having verification steps in the same workflow provided a reference point to identify the inconsistency.

6. **Multi-trigger workflows:** When workflows can be triggered multiple ways, use flexible patterns (`@.*`) rather than hardcoding specific refs, while maintaining security through other parameters.

7. **End-to-end testing:** Signature verification should be tested in CI with actual artifacts, not just assumed to work. The current workflow has this (good!), but it would have caught this bug on first run.

8. **Verify expert assumptions:** Even expert analysis can be based on incorrect assumptions. When investigating issues, verify actual tool behavior rather than relying solely on documentation or assumptions. In this case, the expert's claim about `tarpaulin-report.xml` was factually incorrect.

9. **Tool-specific knowledge:** Understanding the exact behavior of tools (like tarpaulin's hardcoded output filenames) is essential for accurate configuration and troubleshooting. Generic assumptions about "typical" tool behavior can lead to false positive issue reports.

## Major Finding #3: Coverage Artifact Filename Mismatch Risk

### Expert's Report Analysis

> **Coverage artifact filename mismatch risk**
> - Location: `ci.yml` Codecov upload and comment steps expect `target/tarpaulin/cobertura.xml` (`ci.yml:234-261, 243-249, 261`).
> - In `.tarpaulin.toml` the XML output is enabled, but tarpaulin often writes `tarpaulin-report.xml` by default for XML. If the filename is `tarpaulin-report.xml`, the Codecov upload and PR comment steps won't find it (guarded by `hashFiles` and `fail_ci_if_error: false`).
> - Fix options:
>   - Standardize the filename: change CI to `files: target/tarpaulin/tarpaulin-report.xml` and read the same in the comment step; or
>   - Configure tarpaulin to emit `cobertura.xml` explicitly (if supported) and keep CI as-is; or
>   - Switch to `cargo-llvm-cov` which produces consistent artifacts across platforms.

### Verification Status: ❌ INCORRECT

The expert's analysis is **not accurate**. After thorough research and verification, this issue does not exist.

### Investigation Findings

**Current Configuration:**

1. **.tarpaulin.toml (lines 7, 10):**
   ```toml
   out = ["Html", "Xml", "Json", "Lcov"]
   output-dir = "target/tarpaulin"
   ```

2. **ci.yml expectations:**
   - Line 238: `files: target/tarpaulin/cobertura.xml`
   - Line 244: `hashFiles('target/tarpaulin/cobertura.xml')`
   - Line 248: `hashFiles('target/tarpaulin/cobertura.xml')`
   - Line 261: `fs.readFileSync('target/tarpaulin/cobertura.xml', 'utf8')`

**Tarpaulin XML Output Behavior:**

From extensive research and local verification:

1. **Tarpaulin XML filename is hardcoded:** When tarpaulin generates XML output, it ALWAYS creates a file named `cobertura.xml` (Cobertura format)
2. **The filename cannot be customized:** Tarpaulin does not provide any option to change the XML output filename
3. **`tarpaulin-report.xml` does not exist:** This filename pattern is NOT used by tarpaulin for XML output

**Actual File Outputs:**

Verification from local tarpaulin run in `target/tarpaulin/`:
```
-rw-r--r--  11857 Oct  5 18:48 cobertura.xml           ← XML output
-rw-r--r--   5764 Oct  5 18:48 lcov.info               ← Lcov output
-rw-r--r--  28837 Oct  5 18:48 ruloc-coverage.json     ← Json output (with project name)
-rw-r--r-- 462698 Oct  5 18:48 tarpaulin-report.html   ← HTML output
-rw-r--r-- 158476 Oct  5 18:48 tarpaulin-report.json   ← Raw Json output
```

**Key Observations:**

1. ✅ XML is named `cobertura.xml` (matches CI expectation)
2. ✅ HTML is named `tarpaulin-report.html` (this is where the expert likely got confused)
3. ✅ Only HTML and raw JSON use the `tarpaulin-report.*` naming pattern
4. ✅ XML uses Cobertura format with fixed `cobertura.xml` name

### Root Cause of Expert's Confusion

The expert likely confused the HTML output filename pattern (`tarpaulin-report.html`) with the XML output. The statement "tarpaulin often writes `tarpaulin-report.xml` by default for XML" is **factually incorrect**.

Tarpaulin's naming convention:
- **XML:** Always `cobertura.xml` (Cobertura format, hardcoded)
- **HTML:** Always `tarpaulin-report.html` (custom format, hardcoded)
- **JSON (raw):** Always `tarpaulin-report.json` (raw trace data, hardcoded)
- **JSON (coverage):** `{crate-name}-coverage.json` (coverage report, uses crate name)
- **Lcov:** Always `lcov.info` (lcov format, hardcoded)

### Resolution

**Status:** ✅ NO FIX REQUIRED

The current configuration is **already correct** and working as intended:

1. ✅ `.tarpaulin.toml` specifies `Xml` output
2. ✅ Tarpaulin generates `cobertura.xml`
3. ✅ CI expects `cobertura.xml`
4. ✅ All references are consistent

**Evidence the current setup works:**

- The `hashFiles()` guards in lines 244 and 248 protect against missing files
- The `fail_ci_if_error: false` in line 241 allows graceful degradation
- These safeguards are working correctly, not compensating for a filename mismatch

### Documentation Sources

**From Tarpaulin Documentation and Research:**

1. "Tarpaulin doesn't allow you to change the name of the generated cobertura report" (Source: GitHub tarpaulin discussions)
2. XML output always uses Cobertura format with filename `cobertura.xml`
3. The `--output-dir` option only controls the directory, not filenames
4. Filenames are hardcoded in tarpaulin's source code

### Impact Assessment

**Before Investigation:**
- ⚠️ Concern that coverage uploads might be silently failing

**After Investigation:**
- ✅ Configuration is correct
- ✅ File paths match expected output
- ✅ No action required
- ✅ Coverage reporting is working as designed

### Recommendation

**No changes recommended.** The current configuration is correct and the expert's concern was based on incorrect information about tarpaulin's XML output filename.

If coverage uploads are failing in CI, the issue would be unrelated to filename mismatch (e.g., network issues, authentication, tarpaulin execution failure, etc.).

## Conclusion

Three of the expert's findings have been analyzed and addressed. The results are mixed:

**Finding #1 (OIDC Issuer):** ✅ **Accurate and Fixed**
**Finding #2 (Certificate Identity):** ✅ **Accurate and Fixed**
**Finding #3 (Coverage Filename):** ❌ **Incorrect - No Issue Exists**

### Summary of Actions

**Issue #1: OIDC Issuer Misconfiguration**
- **Status:** Fixed
- **Change:** `--oidc-issuer="${FULCIO_URL}"` → `--oidc-issuer="https://token.actions.githubusercontent.com"`
- **Impact:** Signing operations will now succeed and produce verifiable signatures

**Issue #2: Certificate Identity Mismatch**
- **Status:** Fixed
- **Change:** `@refs/heads/master` → `@.*` in verification identity pattern (2 locations)
- **Impact:** Verification will now succeed for tag-triggered and manual releases

**Issue #3: Coverage Artifact Filename Mismatch**
- **Status:** Verified as incorrect
- **Finding:** No filename mismatch exists. Tarpaulin outputs `cobertura.xml`, which matches CI expectations exactly
- **Root cause:** Expert confused HTML output filename (`tarpaulin-report.html`) with XML output
- **Impact:** No action required; configuration is already correct

### Critical Impact

**Findings #1 and #2** were not minor issues - they would have caused **complete failure** of the signing and verification system:
- ❌ Signing might fail entirely
- ❌ Even if signing succeeded, verification would always fail
- ❌ Users could not verify artifact authenticity
- ❌ Supply chain security guarantees would be non-functional

With these fixes:
- ✅ Signing will work correctly
- ✅ Verification will work correctly
- ✅ Users can verify artifacts
- ✅ Supply chain security is functional

**Finding #3** highlighted the importance of verifying assumptions with actual tool behavior before implementing fixes.

### Process Improvements

This analysis demonstrated:
1. **Value of independent verification:** Not all expert findings are correct
2. **Importance of testing:** Local verification revealed the actual tarpaulin output
3. **Tool-specific knowledge matters:** Generic assumptions about tool behavior can be misleading

**Next Steps:**
1. ✅ Commit the fixes for findings #1 and #2
2. ✅ Document the verification of finding #3
3. Monitor the next production release to confirm signatures are created and verifiable
4. Consider addressing the remaining findings (#4, #5) from the expert's report if they prove accurate upon investigation
